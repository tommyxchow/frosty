December 29, 2025

### New Features

- **Resizable chat & video**: You can now resize the chat and video areas in landscape mode by dragging the divider to your preferred position.
- **Offline followed channels**: A new section in the Following tab allows you to see which of your followed channels are currently offline.
- **Custom username colors**: Personalize your presence in chat with a new color selection feature and contrast-aware adjustments for better readability.
- **Shared chat support**: Frosty now detects when streamers are in a "Shared Chat" (collab), showing colored borders to indicate which channel a message came from and automatically loading all relevant emotes.
- **Random accent color button**: Quickly find a new look for the app with a random color generator for the accent color in settings.
- **Tap to show deleted messages**: Messages deleted by moderators can now be revealed with a simple tap.
- **Enhanced photo viewer**: View profile pictures and emotes in full resolution with a new blurred background and intuitive swipe-to-dismiss gestures.
- **Haptic feedback**: Added subtle vibrations when performing certain actions, like long-pressing messages or using the new swipe gesture, for a more tactile feel.
- **Inline reconnect**: If your chat connection drops, Frosty now attempts to reconnect silently in the background without interrupting your viewing experience.

### Improvements

- **Enhanced Picture-in-Picture (PiP)**: Significant improvements to PiP mode, including a new swipe-down gesture to enter PiP and better reliability on iOS.
- **Redesigned video overlay**: A cleaner, more modern overlay with improved gradients, text shadows for better readability, and a dedicated offline indicator.
- **Modern blurred effects**: Introduced blurred containers for app bars, overlays, and dialogs for a more premium, cohesive look.
- **Smoother loading animations**: Replaced traditional loading spinners with pulsing placeholders that match the app's layout, making the interface feel more stable while content loads.
- **Optimized landscape layout**: Improved handling for devices with screen cutouts (notches) to ensure the UI is always fully visible.
- **Consistent UI styling**: Standardized scrollbars, dialogs, and dividers across the entire app for a more polished experience.
- **Performance & reliability**: The app's networking and data handling have been completely rewritten to be faster and more reliable.
- **Enhanced chat interactions**: Improved formatting for chat replies, added "Copy and Paste" functionality for messages, and a clearer countdown for chat delays.

## Motivation

The official Twitch mobile app doesn't support emotes from [7TV](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/7tv/ammjkodgmmoknidbanneddgankgfejfh), [BetterTTV (BTTV)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/betterttv/ajopnjidmegmdimjlfnijceegpefgped), and [FrankerFaceZ (FFZ)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/frankerfacez/fadndhdgpmmaapbmfcknlfgcflmmmieb) — third-party services and extensions for Twitch used by millions of viewers and many top channels. This results in a poor mobile chat experience since only emote codes render rather than their image or GIF counterpart.

## Features

- Support for 7TV, BetterTTV, and FrankerFaceZ emotes and badges
- Browse followed streams, top streams, and top categories
- Autocomplete for emotes and user mentions
- Light, dark, and black (OLED) themes
- Search for channels and categories
- See and filter chatters in a channel
- Local chat user message history
- Theater and fullscreen mode
- Watch live streams with chat
- Picture-in-picture mode
- Block and report users
- Emote menu
- Sleep timer
- And more...

## Development setup

1. Go to the [Twitch dev console](https://dev.twitch.tv/login) and register a new application to retrieve a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

2. Clone the repo to a directory (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/tommyxchow/frosty.git`).

3. Navigate to `lib/constants.dart` and replace the `clientId` and `secret` constants with your **client ID** and **client secret** from step 1 (if using VSCode, use `--dart-define` to [define them as environment variables](https://dartcode.org/docs/using-dart-define-in-flutter/)).

4. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch all the dependencies.

5. Choose an emulator or device and run the app!

> Frosty uses [MobX](https://mobx.netlify.app/) for state management. Please refer to the documentation about code generation, otherwise your changes within MobX stores may not be applied.

> **Warning**

> I built Frosty while learning Flutter, so some of the code may not be optimal. I'm working on refactoring, documenting, and cleaning up various parts as much as I can.

## Feature requests and issues
